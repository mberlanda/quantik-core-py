    Check if there is a winning line (row, column, or 2Ã—2 zone) with all four
    different shapes (A, B, C, D).

    Colors don't matter for winning - only the presence of all four shapes in a line.

    Examples of valid wins in row 0:
    - ABCD (all Player 0)
    - abcd (all Player 1)
    - AbCd (mixed players)
    - aBcD (mixed players)
